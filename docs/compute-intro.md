# Introduction

There are many compute services in AWS, but they can be generally divided into three types; **Virtual Machines** (Instances), **Container Services**, or **Serverless**. For VMs in AWS, this is called Elastic Compute Cloud (**EC2**).

A summary of all compute services can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/products/compute/).
