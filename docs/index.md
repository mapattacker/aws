# AWS Guide

This documentation serves as a collection of AWS guides for my own consumption. Hope it can help you in the journey to master how to use services in this dominant cloud provider.

Some of the resources that I learnt from and used heavily in this site are as follows. I will encourage everyone to sign up for their excellent courses.

 * [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-training-course/) - Digital Cloud
 * [AWS Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aws-fundamentals#courses)
 * [Building Modern Python Applications on AWS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-modern-python-applications-on-aws?)
