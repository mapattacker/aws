# AWS Guide

This documentation serves as a collection of AWS guides for my own consumption. Hope it can help you in the journey to master how to use services in this dominant cloud provider.

Some of the resources that I learnt from and used heavily in this site are:

 * [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-training-course/)
 * [AWS Fundamentals Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aws-fundamentals#courses)
 * [Building Modern Python Applications on AWS](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-modern-python-applications-on-aws?)
