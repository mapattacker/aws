# AWS Models

## Shared Responsibility Model

AWS is responsible for **Security of the Cloud**, which includes all the infrastructure.

Customers are responsible for **Security in the Cloud**, which include things like operating system patches, IAM user management, client and server encryption.

## Well-Architected Framework

AWS [Well-Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/?wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-by=item.additionalFields.sortDate&wa-lens-whitepapers.sort-order=desc) describes the key concepts, design principles, and architectural best practices for designing and running workloads in the cloud.

**[Operational Excellence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/operational-excellence-pillar/design-principles.html)**
 * Perform operations as code
 * Make frequent, small, reversible changes
 * Refine operations procedures frequently
 * Anticipate failure
 * Learn from all operational failures

**[Security](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/security.html)**  
 * Implement a strong identity foundation
 * Enable traceability
 * Apply security at all layers
 * Automate security best practices
 * Protect data in transit and at rest
 * Keep people away from data
 * Prepare for security events

**[Reliability](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/design-principles.html)**
 * Automatically recover from failure
 * Test recovery procedures
 * Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability
 * Stop guessing capacity
 * Manage change in automation

**[Performance Efficiency](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/performance-efficiency-pillar/design-principles.html)**
 * Democratize advanced technologies
 * Go global in minutes
 * Use serverless architectures
 * Experiment more often
 * Consider mechanical sympathy 

**[Cost Optimization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/cost-optimization-pillar/design-principles.html)**
