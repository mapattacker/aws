# DynamoDB

DynamoDB is a serverless, non-relational database.

It charges based on the usage of the table and the amount of data that you are storing in that table, not by the hour or by the second.

## Core Components

In DynamoDB, tables, items, and attributes are the core components that you work with. 

A **table** is a collection of items, and each **item** is a collection of **attributes**. DynamoDB uses **primary keys** to uniquely identify each item in a table and secondary indexes to provide more querying flexibility. 

## Security

DynamoDB offers encryption at rest, which eliminates the operational burden and complexity involved in protecting sensitive data.
