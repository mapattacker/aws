# RDS

Relational Database Service (RDS) is a suite of relational databases provided by AWS. They run on EC2 instances under the hood.

 * Commercial: Oracle, SQL Server
 * Open Source: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MariaDB
 * Cloud Native: Amazon Aurora

The cloud native option, **Amazon Aurora**, is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible database built for the cloud. It is more durable, more available, and provides faster performance than the Amazon RDS version of MySQL and PostgreSQL.
